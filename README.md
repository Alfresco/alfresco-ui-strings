# UI Strings used in Alfresco

This repository contains all the strings used in the user interfaces that Alfresco develop.

If you're building custom solutions on top of Alfresco or you're extending our supplied UIs, then you might like to look at these strings to see if there are some already reviewed and translated strings you can reuse. This is especially useful if you're sending a Pull Request to one of our projects that includes some new UI.

If you need to use a new string, you might like to refer to our [Writing for Alfresco guidelines](http://docs.alfresco.com/sites/docs.alfresco.com/files/public/docs_team/u2/Alfresco-Writing-Guide.pdf)[pdf].
